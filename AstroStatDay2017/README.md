### CfA Astro Stat Day 2017
#### Wednesday, Sep 20, 2017
#### 10:00am-5:00pm // Phillips Auditorium

Wolbach Library supported a gathering of CfA researchers who are involved and interested in AstroStatistics and AstroInformatics. The goal was to get together and learn about various research groups who are working on methods to deal with data issues. There are many such groups at the CfA working on developing new algorithms and this was an opportunity to meet, exchange ideas, and learn about each other.
